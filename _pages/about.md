I'm exploring.

Previously, I developed models for automated valuations and other high stakes algorithmic decision making at [Opendoor](http://opendoor.com), did research on transfer learning in AI/robotics at [OpenAI](http://openai.com/), and led deep learning efforts to build a collaborative human-machine intelligence system at [Clara Labs](http://claralabs.com). I've also worked on speech synthesis and computational neuroscience, built [Mosaic](http://mosaic.io), and founded a mobile behavioral analytics [company](http://watchsend.com) through [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com).

I most recently built a [GIF search engine](http://deepgif.tarzain.com) using deep multimodal embeddings.
