I'm a research scientist at [OpenAI](http://openai.com/).

Previously I led deep learning efforts to build a collaborative human-machine intelligence system at [Clara Labs](http://claralabs.com). I've also worked on speech synthesis and computational neuroscience, built [Mosaic](http://mosaic.io), and founded a mobile behavioral analytics [company](http://watchsend.com) through [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com).

I most recently built a [GIF search engine](http://deepgif.tarzain.com) using deep multimodal embeddings.

This theme is inspired by [Kiko](http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko) theme, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

This blog is a compressed version of me. If you want to get in touch with the real me, feel free to email me at xzvf AT tarzain DOT com
