Title: Predictive (productive), not communicable, AI. Communicate through existing channels.

AI will be used for faster than human, better than communication. It will be used for intelligent despite no communication. People communicate out of necessity, and when you are working to reduce necessity of things, you work to reduce communication. So the future isn't a personal assistant to whom you say "Open the garage" it is one you raise when you need to open the garage and it presents a button that says "open the garage" automatically. The Google Now model will far supersede that of the understander of communication. We don't want something that can communicate with us, and AI as turing expected it will never exist of our intent, collectively. It would be fundamentally misguided.
