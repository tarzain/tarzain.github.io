Title: Why is college necessarily so transformative?

College is the best place to go when you want to learn what real friends are. If you were apparently well developed in high school, then you could have learned it then, but it's unlikely. This is because it is so unlikely that you were smart enough then to really evaluate this. This being the evaluation that those you are selecting are the best of all available to you. The highest expected value of companionship options you've chosen are those you chose to become friends with. You are thrown into a completely blank slate environment with no predispositions, and so you can expect your decisions to be made knowing you're doing the best you can, with as little from outside affecting your decision as possible. Those conjugates of this circumstance, the strangers of whom some are to become your closest companions, possess the same agency in their friend decisions.
