Title: Windows

It's become increasingly obvious to me that I've never really felt as compelled about a future I'd like to see exist as much as I do now.
Everything I've (rather mysteriously, even to me) been captivated to work on, and everything that really began my interest in computers at all, somehow suddenly becomes part of a grander vision. This is a single coherent interface for human interaction with computers, a world of smart, connected, windows. Where each device, a sensing, aware, input/output medium provides an intuitive yet powerful method of interacting with each other and overcoming the challenges of our world.
The metaphor itself is rather simple, while the technical challenges involved are about as hard as they come. We've already managed to solve most of the hard problems actually. Over the past 100 years we've developed the technologies and algorithms to efficiently and robustly store information (mostly thanks to the genius Claude Shannon) and as we further enable the miniaturization of the processing of this information, something we've really been working towards for a very long time is coming into focus. Despite having enabled the storage and processing of this information, the true power of computers came by the interface we used to manipulate the information. 
It's like I've always known that computers should be able to infer, from simple sensors, far more than they already did. One of the first projects of mine, ever, was a software defined infrared filter for my laptops webcam. Whereby I could finally control my simple windows xp laptop with my hands and rid myself of typing. I want
